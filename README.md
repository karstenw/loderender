### loderender



loderender renders Loder Runner Levels on C-64 disk images as png files.

Much of the code for this was ripped out of geosLib [geosLib](https://github.com/karstenw/geosLib)

#### Usage:

python loderender.py LoderunnerDiskImage.d64


This creates a folder named "LoderunnerDiskImage" and renders all the levels it can find on the disc image.
